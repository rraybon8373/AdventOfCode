Advent of Code is an annual advent calendar of programming puzzles. The puzzles cover a variety of skill sets and skill levels and can be solved using any programming language. Participants also compete based on speed on both global and private leaderboards.

In general, fun programming problems that eventually make you want to tear your hair out closer to Christmas.

One of these years I'll finish the whole thing...
